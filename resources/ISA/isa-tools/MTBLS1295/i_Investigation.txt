Study Title	Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis is Associated with Altered Bile Acid Metabolism in Infantile Cholestasis
Study Description	<p>The co-occurrence of gut microbiota dysbiosis and bile acids (BAs) metabolism alteration has been reported in several human liver diseases. However, the gut microbiota dysbiosis in infantile cholestatic jaundice (CJ), and the linkage between gut bacterial changes and alterations of BAs metabolism are undetermined. To address this question, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine the compositional and functional differences in gut microbiota, and access their association with fecal levels of primary and secondary BAs in infants with CJ. Our data revealed that CJ infants showed marked declines in fecal levels of primary BAs and most secondary BAs. A decreased ratio of cholic acid (CA):chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in CJ indicated a shift in BA synthesis from the primary to the alternative BA pathway. The CJ-enriched bacterial taxa corresponds to genera Clostridium, Gemella, Streptococcus, Veillonella, and family Enterobacteriaceae were negatively correlated with fecal BAs level and the CDCA:CA ratio, but positively correlated with the serological indexes of liver functions. An increased ratio of deoxycholic acid (DCA):CA was observed in a proportion of CJ. The CJ-depleted bacteria, including Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, were positively and negatively correlated with fecal levels of BAs and the serological markers of impaired liver function, respectively. In conclusion, the reduced concentration of BAs in the gut of CJ is correlated with gut microbiota dysbiosis. The altered gut microbiota of CJ is likely to upregulate the conversion from primary to secondary BAs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Linked cross omic data sets:</strong></p><p>Raw sequencing data associated with this study are available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA): accession number <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB33641' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>PRJEB33641</a>.</p>

Study Protocol Description	<p>A total of 126 infants were recruited to the study cohort from Shanghai Children’s Hospital, China, between September 2016 and March 2019. The diagnosis of CJ in infants was based on the guidelines described in Moyer et al. (2004) [1] and Fawaz et al. (2017) [2]. An abnormal direct bilirubin (DB) is defined as a value greater than 17 μmol/l if the total bilirubin (TB) is less than 85 μmol/l, or a value of DB that represents more than 20% of the TB if the TB is greater than 85 μmol/l [1]. Serological test for liver function was performed, and indexes including BA, DB, TB, Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and albumin (ALB) of patients were measured by using AU5800 clinical chemistry analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, United States). Hemoglobin (HB) was measured by SLS hemoglobin test from Sysmex XN-1000 automatic hematology analyzer (Sysmex Corporation). Twenty-five infants with normal levels of DB, TB, but with elevated AST and ALT levels were enrolled in the study as control, termed as impaired hepatic function (IHF) group. Forty-five healthy infants without any history of chronic diseases were enrolled as healthy control (HC). None of the healthy individuals had clinically relevant CJ or any symptoms at the time of fecal collection, and subjects who took antibiotics within two months before fecal collection, or in any inflammatory conditions were excluded from the study. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians of infants eligible for the study enrollment. This study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Boards of Shanghai Children’s Hospital and carried out accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki of 1964 and later versions.</p><p><br></p><p>Stool samples were collected with sterile swabs by nursing staff at Shanghai Children’s Hospital, and stored at -80℃.

An aliquot of 150 µl of acetonitrile containing internal standards (D4-TCA, D4-LCA, D4-CA, D4-GCA, D4-DCA, D4-GCDCA, D4-GDCA) was added and the extraction was performed using the homogenizer. After centrifugation, 50 µl of the supernatant was transferred to a 96-well plate and diluted with 150 µl of mobile phase mixture (mobile phase B: mobile phase A = 50:50, v/v).</p>	<p>A Waters Acquity UPLC system equipped with a binary solvent delivery manager and a sample manager (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) was used throughout the study. The mass spectrometer was a Waters XEVO TQ-S instrument with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source (Waters). The entire LC-MS system was controlled by MassLynx 4.1 software (Waters). All chromatographic separations were performed with an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 μm, 100 mm×2.1 mm internal dimensions; Waters). The mobile phase consisted of 10 mM ammonium acetate adjusted to pH 4 (mobile phase A) and ACN:MeOH (8:2) (mobile phase B) run at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The LC elution conditions were optimized as follows: isocratic at 5% B (0–0.5 min), gradient from 10 to 75% B (0.5–15.5 min), isocratic at 100% B (15.5–16.3 min); and isocratic at 5% B (16.3–17.0 min). The column was maintained at 40 °C, and the injection volume of all samples was 5 μl.</p>	<p>A XEVO TQ-S mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, USA) was used to quantitate the bile acids with the following settings;</p><p>Scan Polarity: Negative</p><p>Scan m/z range: 350-600</p><p>Ion Source: ESI</p><p>Mass Analyzer: MassLynx</p>	<p>The raw data was transformed to NetCDF file by Masslynx software (DataBridge)</p>	<p>Data were processed using the TargetLynx application manager (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) to obtain calibration equations and the measured concentration of each bile acid in the samples.
