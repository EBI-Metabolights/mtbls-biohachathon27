Study Title	Gut Microbial Genes and Metabolism for Methionine and Branched-Chain Amino Acids in Diabetic Nephropathy
Study Description	<p>Diabetic mellitus nephropathy (DMN) is a serious complication of diabetes and a major health concern. Although the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus (DM) leading to DMN is uncertain, recent evidence suggests the involvement of the gut microbiome. This study aimed to determine the relationships among gut microbial species, genes and metabolites in DMN through an integrated clinical, taxonomic, genomic and metabolomic analysis. Whole metagenome shotgun sequencing and nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomic analysis were performed on stool samples from 15 patients with DMNs and 22 healthy controls. Six bacterial species were identified to be significantly elevated in the DMN patients after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Multivariate analysis found 216 microbial genes and 6 metabolites (valine, isoleucine, methionine, valerate and phenylacetate levels in the DMN group and higher acetate levels in the control group) that were differentially present between the DMN and control groups. Integrated analysis of all these parameters and clinical data, using the random forest model, showed that methionine and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) were among the most significant features, next to eGFR and proteinuria, in differentiating DMN from the control group. Metabolic pathway gene analysis of BCAA and methionine also revealed that many genes involved in the biosynthesis of these metabolites were elevated in the 6 species that were more abundant in the DMN group. The suggested correlation among taxonomic, genetic and metabolic features of the gut microbiome would expand our understanding of gut microbial involvement in the pathogenesis of DMN and may provide potential therapeutic targets of DMN.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Linked cross omic data sets:</strong></p><p>Raw sequencing data associated with this study are available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA): accession number <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB57320' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>PRJEB57320</a>.</p>

Study Protocol Description	<p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Seoul National University Hospital (IRB number: 1808-153-967) and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Human resources were obtained from the stool repository (IRB number: 1404-117-575) after the review and approval of the research proposals by the Institutional Review Board of the Seoul National University Hospital. Participants who provided informed consent for genomic analysis and deposition of fecal specimens in the human fecal repository were included.</p><p><br></p><p>Patients with biopsy-proven <strong>diabetic nephropathy</strong> were included in the <strong>DMN group</strong>. Adults, who were identified to be <strong>healthy</strong> enough to donate their kidneys through a comprehensive medical checkup performed before kidney donation surgery were included in the <strong>control group</strong>. Data on demographic characteristics, including age, sex, height and weight, of the DMN and control groups were collected. Laboratory findings relevant to DMN, including serum creatinine, blood HbA1c, serum glucose, random urine protein, and random urine creatinine, were also obtained. The body mass index (BMI) was calculated as body weight (kg) divided by height in meters squared. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a marker of kidney function, was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration calculation formula. In the DMN group, the duration of diabetes and the types of glucose-lowering agents used at the time of sample collection were also determined.</p>	<p>Metabolite extraction from stool samples was performed using liquid-liquid extraction. Stool samples stored at -80 °C were thawed on ice. In total 400 μL of methanol and 200 μL of chloroform were added to 200 mg stool samples. The mixture was vortexed for 30 s, frozen in liquid nitrogen for 1 min and thawed at room temperature. After 3 freeze-thaw cycles, 200 μL of chloroform and 200 μL of water were added to the samples, and they were again vortexed for 30 s. Finally, the mixtures were centrifuged for 20 min at 18,500 x g at 4 °C. Water-soluble and lipid-soluble layers of the supernatant were separated and dried for 4 h using a centrifugal vacuum concentrator.</p>	<p>Pellets from the water-soluble layer were resuspended in 500 μL nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) buffer (5 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM Na2HPO4, 0.025% sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate-d4 [TSP] in deuterium oxide [D2O]), and pellets from the lipid-soluble layer were resuspended in 500 μL deuterated chloroform (CDCl3). Finally, 500 μL of stool extracts were transferred to 5 mm NMR tubes.&nbsp;</p>	<p>Proton NMR spectra were acquired with an 800 MHz NMR spectrometer (Avanche III; Bruker Biospin, Germany) operating at an 800.19 MHz proton at 298 K using a 1D NOESY pulse sequence (noesypr1d). The proton spectral FID was collected with 32 K complex data points, 12 ppm spectral width and 128 scans.&nbsp;</p>	<p>Proton NMR spectra were acquired with an 800 MHz NMR spectrometer (Avanche III; Bruker Biospin, Germany) operating at an 800.19 MHz proton at 298 K using a 1D NOESY pulse sequence (noesypr1d). The proton spectral FID was collected with 32 K complex data points, 12 ppm spectral width and 128 scans.&nbsp;</p>	<p>The proton NMR spectral data were processed by Fourier transformation, phase correction, baseline correction and referencing. Spectral data from the water-soluble metabolites were normalized using the internal standard trimethylsilyl-propanoic acid (TSP) signal, binned to a width of 0.0147 ppm using an in-house <strong>Perl</strong> script and numerically transformed. Spectral data from the lipid-soluble metabolites were normalized against deuterated chloroform and binned to a width of 0.0055 ppm. Spectral regions of TSP (0.0-0.2 ppm), glycerol (3.34-3.38 and 3.52-3.82 ppm) and water (4.7-4.9 ppm) were excluded for the analysis of water-soluble metabolites, and the spectral region of chloroform (7.2-7.3 ppm) was excluded for the analysis of lipid-soluble metabolites.</p>	<p>For metabolite identification, all proton NMR signals were referenced using TSP (for water-soluble metabolites) or chloroform (for lipid-soluble metabolites) signals and identified using the <strong>Chenomx</strong> NMR Suite (Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada).</p>
